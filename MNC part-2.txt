1)
Problem Statement –A chocolate factory is packing chocolates into the packets. The
chocolate packets here represent an array of N number of integer values. The task is to find
the empty packets(0) of chocolate and push it to the end of the conveyor belt(array).
Example 1 :
N=8 and arr = [4,5,0,1,9,0,5,0] There are 3 empty packets in the given set. These 3 empty
packets represented as O should be pushed towards the end of the array
Input :
8 – Value of N
[4,5,0,1,9,0,5,0] – Element of arr[O] to arr[N-1],While input each element is separated by
newline
Output:
4 5 1 9 5 0 0 0

Ans)
public class Exc{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int arr[] = {4,5,0,1,9,0,5,0};
        for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
            if(arr[i]!=0){
                System.out.print(arr[i]+" ");
            }
        }
        for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
            if(arr[i]==0){
                System.out.print(arr[i]+" ");
            }
        }
    }
}

2)
Given an integer array Arr of size N the task is to find the count of elements whose value is
greater than all of its prior elements.
Note : 1st element of the array should be considered in the count of the result.
For example,
Arr[]={7,4,8,2,9}
As 7 is the first element, it will consider in the result.
8 and 9 are also the elements that are greater than all of its previous elements.
Since total of 3 elements is present in the array that meets the condition.
Hence the output = 3.
