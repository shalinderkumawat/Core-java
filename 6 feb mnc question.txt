lucky numbers are 3,5 and 7. Help him find the number, whose sum is divisible by 3 or 5 or
7. Provide a valid car number, Fails to provide a valid input then display that number is not a
valid car number.
Note : The input other than 4 digit positive number[includes negative and 0] is considered as
invalid.
Refer the samples, to read and display the data.

Q4)
Problem Statement – To speed up his composition of generating unpredictable rhythms,
Blue Bandit wants the list of prime numbers available in a range of numbers.Can you help
him out?
Write a java program to print all prime numbers in the interval [a,b] (a and b, both inclusive).
Note
Input 1 should be lesser than Input 2. Both the inputs should be positive.
Range must always be greater than zero.
If any of the condition mentioned above fails, then display “Provide valid input”
Use a minimum of one for loop and one while loop

Ans)
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Mnc {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the starting number ");
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Enter the ending number ");
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        for(;a<=b;){
            int count = 0;
            for(int i=2; i<a; i++){
                if(a%i==0){
                    count++;
                }
            }
            if(count==0){

Problem Statement – FOE college wants to recognize the department which has
succeeded in getting the maximum number of placements for this academic year.
The departments that have participated in the recruitment drive are CSE,ECE,
MECH. Help the college find the department getting maximum placements. Check
for all the possible output given in the sample snapshot

10)
Problem Statement – Write a program to calculate the fuel consumption of your
truck.The program should ask the user to enter the quantity of diesel to fill up the
tank and the distance covered till the tank goes dry.Calculate the fuel consumption
and display it in the format (liters per 100 kilometers).
Convert the same result to the U.S. style of miles per gallon and display the result. If
the quantity or distance is zero or negative display ” is an Invalid Input”.
[Note: The US approach of fuel consumption calculation (distance / fuel) is the
inverse of the European approach (fuel / distance ). Also note that 1 kilometer is
0.6214 miles, and 1 liter is 0.2642 gallons.]

Ans)
import java.util.*;

    public class Main{
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
            System.out.println("Enter the quantity of fuel");
            float fuel = sc.nextFloat();
            System.out.println("Enter the distance covered");
            float dist = sc.nextFloat();
            double mile = dist*0.6214;
            double gallen = fuel*0.2642;
            double fcon = mile/gallen;
            System.out.println("The fuel consumption is "+fcon);
        }
    }
